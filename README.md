# google-homepage

August 11 2017
This google-homepage project is my first odin project created. Overtime I should see chronological progress not only with this individual project, but all of them as a whole.

August 14 2017
The project is mostly finished, likely 90%. Future usage of this project may be to allow to it to take in form input and search the input. JavaScript will need to be utilized however, which is for another day/currently out of my scope of knowledge.

Fixed elements stacking on top of one another on top navigation bar by adding a min-width rule. Also added link to odinproject curriculum inside README.md
